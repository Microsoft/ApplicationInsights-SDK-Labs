    about_PSApplicationInsights

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PSApplicationInsights is a module that provides PowerShell friendly overloads for the core Application Insights SDK.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSApplicationInsights provides a new PowerShell cmdlet, New-TelemetryClient, and overloads existing Track* calls
    to support Hashtables which have a more natual syntax in PowerShell. It is packaged as a single module with the latest
    version of Application Insights and has working examples for all of the Track* calls. 

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    PSApplicationInsights was written with two scenarios in mind
    1) Allowing a PowerShell developer to more easily integrate PowerShell scripts and telemetry to existing apps

    Example: A web app hosted in Azure with a SQL Azure backend is likely to have existing web app telemetry. 
    This app may perform common automation tasks such as invoking a webhook as an alert rule, or scheduled scale up and 
    scale down of the SQL Azure database. Using PSApplicationInsights one can quick add telemetry to these automation tasks 
    from their scripts or runbooks, such as: 
        TrackEvent('Sql Resize'. @{databaseName=$databaseName}, @{resizeTime=$duration.Seconds}).

    2) Allowing PowerShell script authors to more easily instrument their scripts to track script and feature usage
    
    Example: Wouldn't it be nice to know what cmdlets get used the most? Or if users are actually using that 
    alternate parameter set you defined? PSApplicationInsights makes it easy and natural to instrument your scripts 
    using the Application Insights SDK
